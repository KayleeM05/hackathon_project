* My initial idea for the hackathon, being **AICHEMI**

## What is AICHEMI?
While working on my group Capstone Project from January 2025 to April 2025, I had the task of researching seperation methods, and implimenting them into the simulation, being DWSIM.

This application uses OPEN-AI to search through records, using the input needs of the user (desired seperation methods, flow rates, temperature, pressure, etc) in order to search and decide the best seperation method for the desired outcome.
